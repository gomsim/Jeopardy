A friend's birthday was eminent, upon which I'd promised to hold a Jeopardy session, so I made this implementation.

Most people have probably heard of Jeopardy. It's a sort of quiz game. A grid of "cards" is laid out, each column representing a category and each row representing a level of dificulty. Underneath each card is a statement. Upon chosing a card the undelying statement is shown for which the player must guess the question for which the statement is the answer. Like in the gif below, the statement is (in swedish) "neither an ent, nor a tree" for which the correct response is "What is a huorn" (Lord of the Rings trivia).

The game draws the contents of the cards from a file game.txt in the same directory. By replacing game.txt new game sessions can be enjoyed.
