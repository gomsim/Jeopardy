Welcome to Jeopardy! A game of fun and joy!

THE GAME
Jeopardy is a great twist on a typical quiz. It's a game that lets the game host 
give the answers while the players ask the questions. 

The game shows a grid of cards. The columns represent categories and the rows 
represent different levels of difficulty.

Start:
The starting player is chosen at random. The player then chooses a card of a 
difficulty of choice from one of the categories. Upon turning the card a 
statement is presented, representing what would be the answer to an unknown 
question. The players' job is then to guess what the question to the answer might 
be. For example, "The jumping man wearing a red hat." might be the answer to 
"Who is Super Mario?"

Upon turning a card:
While the choice of card was up to a certain player, any player has the chance
 to come up with a suggestion. The players have a set amount of time to think. 
 The first player to say their name (or in any way signalling they have an 
 answer, which has been agreed upon beforehand) will get to give their suggestion.

After a card:
Would the player give the correct suggestion that player recieves the amount of 
points shown on the question cars backside before turning it. This way the 
choice of question becomes a balancing act between challenge and reward. However 
would the player give the wrong suggestion, then the other players have a set 
amount of time (usually shorter) to come up with their own suggestions. Would no 
player come up with the right suggestion, either after one player has first 
tried or without any player getting the chance to try, no one is given points, 
the answer is revealed, and the game proceeds. The choice of the next card is 
given to the player who came up with the right suggestion, alternatively if no 
one got the right suggestion, to the player who chose the last card. 
Additionally, giving a wrong suggestion subtracts the card's score from the 
player's score.

The game is played until all cards are turned. The players' scores are then 
counted. The winner is the player with the highest score.

OBS! Despite Jeopardy's concept of the players guessing the questions to the 
answers on the board, In this manual the text on the cards are referred to as 
questions and the players' suggestions as answers, only for the sake of 
readability.

THE SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION
Jeopardy is designed to detect the number of devices (computer or TV-screens) 
connected to the computer at start-up. A GUI is created for each device 
connected. The purpose of this is simply to hide the game host's mouse cursor 
from the players. 
Creator's suggestion: The host sits by the screen that the players will watch. 
The host can then face the players to interact with them easily and pick up on 
visual ques as to who got to the right answer first.

Upon start-up the host will choose a game to be played. The games listed are all 
the *.game files in the games-directory. If desired, an example game can be 
played as a demonstration.

Once started, the game board is shown. To turn a question card the host uses the 
mouse to click on it. The corresponding question will then be displayed. 
Simultaneously a countdown will start, shown in the upper right hand corner of 
the display. The countdown can be stopped at any moment by pressing SPACE. 
Pressing SPACE again starts a new countdown with a usually smaller amount of 
time (can be changed in configurations). To close the card press ENTER.

HOW TO WRITE A GAME FILE
Any game to be played must be a .game file and be located in the games-directory. 
A game file file must be written to a very spcific description. A demonstration 
example for how such a game file can be written can be generated by starting the 
game and choosing the example game in the popup. A game file contains the 
information about the game's categories and questions. The file is composed of a 
series of statments separated by semo-colon (just like Java). Each entry 
represents either a category or a question. Categories are stated as *[category] 
(ie. preceded by a *) while clues are stated as is. Everything in a statment 
written after a #-sign is ignored by the game. It's "commented out". This way, 
meta information such as answers and trivia can be stored in the game file for 
future reference. Would an entire entry be preceded by a #-sign the entry is 
ignored by the game altogether.

Example 1:

--- start of game file, excluding this line ---
*[Category name 1];
[Question text].
    #[Comment];
[Question text].
    #[Comment];

*[Category2];
[Question text].
    #[Comment];
[Question text].
    #[Comment];
#[Question text]. //NOT ADDED TO GAME BECAUSE OF PRECEEDING #
    #[Comment];
--- end of game file, excluding this line ---

Example 2:

--- start of game file, excluding this line ---
*Sagan om ringen;
Den plats som Frodo försöker ta sig till i sagan om ringen.
    #Vad är Mordor;
Den värd som tar emot herr ”Underhill” och hans vänner i Bri.
    #Vem är Barliman Butterbur;
    
*Zelda;
En union av styrka, visdom och mod.
    #Vad är Triforce;
Links hemort i Ocarina of Time tillika den plats där det stora dekuträdet växer.
    #Vad är Kokiriskogen;
#Svärdet som går sönder efter ett få antal slag i Ocarina of Time.
    #Vad är Giant's knife;
--- end of game file, excluding this line ---

Every question entry following a category entry is assumed to correspond to that 
category. The above game file would supply two categories, "Sagan om ringen" and 
"Zelda", containing two questions each.

Other examples:

The game interprets the line...

*Zelda;
En union av styrka, visdom och mod.
    #Vad är Triforce;

...equal to the line...

*Zelda;
En union av styrka, visdom och mod.

...or the line...

*Zelda;
En union av styrka, visdom och mod.#Vad är Triforce;

...or the line...

*Zelda;En union av styrka, visdom och mod.#Vad är Triforce;

...etc. Newlines and tabs are/can be added only for readability of file itself.

Any number of categories and corresponding questions can be added, as long as 
they follow the given format. The questions are added to the game in the order 
they are stated in the game file.

CONFIG FILE
The main folder contains a file config.txt which lets the host configure some 
aspects of the game. As of today those things are the durations of the two 
countdowns or time limits present in the game.

Each entry in the config file are set in the following format: 
"[variable] = [value]", excluding the citations.

Variables:
questionTime - determines the amount of time, in seconds, for the initial 
countdown upon opening a new question card.
extraTime - determines the amount of time, in seconds, for the second countdown, 
activated by pausing the initial countdown and starting it again.

Would the config file be missing or corrupt, the game generates a new config 
file with default values (questionTime = 15; extraTime = 5;).

KEYBOARD CONTROLLS
Enter: closes a question card if shown on the screen.
Space (once): pauses the coundown timer while a question card is being displayed.
Space (second time): starts the coundown timer for a small amount of extra time 
while a question card is being displayed.

TROUBLESHOOT
The game presents fewer categories than is present in the game file.
    Answer: Each category myst have a unique name. Any two categories with the 
    same name are treated as the same category.
The question cars look all mushed up on the main screen.
    Answer: The game runs best with up to 5 categories.
The question cards are all thin. I can't read the numbers.
    Answer: Too many questions in a category will crowd the screen. Try creating 
    games with fewer questions per category. 10 or 15 questions per category is 
    probably the maximum for an enjoyable game.
Some categories have more questions than others.
    Answer: Yes. Of some reason the game is designed to accomodate such 
    scenarios. If the game file contains more questions for certain categories 
    than others, those categories will contain more questions during the game. 
    If you want to keep more questions in the game file than what you want to 
    show during a game session, make sure to comment out the questions you don't 
    want to be shown duwing the game. You do this by starting any unwanted 
    question entry with a #-sign.
